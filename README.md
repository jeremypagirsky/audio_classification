# BirdCLEF-2021 Audio Classification

## Background

The Cornell Lab of Ornithology estimates about 10,000 bird species throughout the world. In addition to their relatively high position in the food chain, this makes birds great informants of air quality and biodiversity in various ecosystems. The identification of birds in their habitats is especially helpful for researchers and ornithological experts to implement conservation efforts.

Machine learning, particularly deep learning, has been helpful in bolstering acoustic data collection. Models to date, however, have presented inconsistencies in precision and recall abilities.

## Objective

This project seeks to implement deep learning techniques to identify bird species captured in audio recordings. Multiple model architectures are constructed and compared against each other for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

## Data

The data was obtained from the [BirdCLEF 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdclef-2021) Kaggle competition.

## Results

Coming soon.

## Future Work

Coming soon.

## For More Information

Coming soon.
